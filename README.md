## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5
-   CSS using custom variables
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

-   It's getting easier to understand Figma files and also look at the requirement on them
-   Gaining a better understanding of semantic HTML and what tags to use
-   The more you practice the easier it becomes but also the more you remember for the next project

### Continued development

-   Continue learning semantic HTML, I want to get to a point where I am choosing he right tags for the right use cases.
-   Organize my CSS file a little more I feel the one I created here was a bit all over.
